# Titanic-Machine_learning-from-disaster
Using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

 Built a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
